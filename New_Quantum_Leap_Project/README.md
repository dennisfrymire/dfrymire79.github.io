# The Ultimate Quantum Leap Quiz

==========================================================================
# CONCEPT
==========================================================================

This is a trivia game focused on the sci-fi TV show, Quantum Leap. 

* The game consists of up to five rounds. 

* Each round has its own category, and includes 10 randomly-generated questions.
 
 * The score is tallied at end of every round. Each correct answer is worth a number of points corresponding to the round (Round 1 questions are worth 1 point, Round 2 questions are worth 2 points, and so on.) Point accumulate from round to round. If the players gets 3 or more wrong answers in any given round, the game is over. 

 Technologies Used:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery

 # Approach
 ===========================================================================

 I first tested the randomly-selected questions in the console, writing out the functions to be able to match questions with correct answers. Then I began building the input forms and buttons to be able to place them in the DOM. 

 I approached the functionality of the game first, and the overall design second, but I knew I wanted to keep it relatively simple and uncluttered, hoping to eventually make it compatible with smaller screens. I accomplished this by having the game game consist mostly of modal elements and pop ups.

 # Challenges
 ============================================================================

 I had somehow thought being able to match the answers to randomly-generated questions would be one of the bigger challenges. I ended up accomplishing that quickly. The biggest challenge turned out to be creating and navigating the various input fields and functions for each round of game play - it ultimately ended up being almost 800 lines of code. I want to continue to revisit this game, and refactor.

 A lesson I learned (or re-learned) is to plan better before I start writing code, properly indent, and to comment on the code AS I WRITE IT, and not after the fact. I lost an hour one day trying to figure out why a mystery button had appeared in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen. Taking the time to re-format my code and provide comments on it fixed the problem. 

 The overall design is admittedly rudimentary. My layout and CSS skills are are items I plan to give more time to developing.

 Final note, I had originally envisioned the game to include a timer with a pre-set amount of time at the start of game play. The counter would have time added or subtracted from it in relation to correct or incorrect answers given. I wasn't able to achieve this, and so I punted with a different way to score the game.
